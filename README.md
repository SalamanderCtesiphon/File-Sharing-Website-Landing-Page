# File-Sharing-Website-Landing-Page
A repository for the files for my first full stack web application; using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Hosted on an Apache server.

I will use this repository to store the main files for the web application I am working on. This is my first attempt at deploying
a full stack web application. I am hoping to learn alot about the practical aspects of the process.
